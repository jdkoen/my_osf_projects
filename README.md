# OSF Projects

This is a list of my data and analysis projects deposited the Open Science Framework (OSF) platform. These repositories include raw and derivate data, analysis code, and summary statistics.

This is not an exhaustive list of my research projects. I am slowly working on making the data and scripts from my published papers open to the scientific community.
